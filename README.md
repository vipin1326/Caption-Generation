# Caption Generation

Here is the code for Image Caption Generation.

Here I use VGG net to extract the features from the images and than combine these features with the textual features of the captions of the images we have.
And the we train model by giving these feature as input and expect a probability score for next word generated as the caption.

Here is the image and caption which is generated by the model for the image.
